# cam.py
# script to take photos from the linksprite LS-Y201 camera
#
# Oriol Sanchez, 9/19/2013
# 
# Changelog:
# V0 9/19/2013
# 
# Readme:
# Freely based on the code linksprite_grab.py of Jon Klein (kleinjt@ieee.org)
# It takes a photo and stores it inside an embedded ARM board,
# in this case the Fox_Board from Acme Systems. Take into account that a relay
# was used to interface the camera with the embedded system, that is why 
# GPIO is used.
#
# Instructions: - execute phyton cam.py from the shell inside the arm
#               - retrieve the picture from the test folder
#
# Advice: my LS-Y201 camera didn't work correctly outdoors, maybe it is only my cam
# or it is all the cams as the linksprite LS-Y201 cam seems to be a PUTAL PTC08 cam
# from china as their control messages seems to be the same and so its specs. Anyway
# light exposure seem to be too long to withstand sunny day conditions.
